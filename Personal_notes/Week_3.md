## Notes for Week 3##

By cloning the repository you can get a local version synhced with Github, where downloading will just give you a Zip file

R is the language (so is GIT), whereas RStudio is the GUI (graphical user interface) where R can be implemeted and used (Github is online interface)

Need to check the version of R and Rstudio constantaly to ensure that all the packages are compatibale and up to date as could form error messages

The platform that operates the system is the laptop (or computer i.e. the terminal) that you use i.e masosx mojavie 12344 etc

The course repository can be sorted out in R 

- Clone repository 
- File
- Create new project
- Version control 
- Git
- Paste URL (keep name of fiel/repository the same)
- Clone to suitable folder
- Create project 
- Finder, Find the folder 
- it is possible to move about the files in the finder and organise it there 
- choose suitable names for files, decide on grammar i.e caps or no caps, any abbbreviations (if everyone creates with slighly different names all the folders will be created as it sees them as different as it is case senistive) 
- Go to Git tab in Rstudio then you will see newly created folders 
- Read D in git tab means delete
- Question marks means something complex has happened, you can click on it and it will tell you what has happened i.e green A means added 
- Make all changes along a themetic change i.e. chnage all of the things that are of a similar theme so you dont get confused anf the work is easy to keep track of 
- commit push pull regualary as you go through the work to esnure that if there is an accident etc there is not a catastrophic loss of work
- Slect what folders and files what want to be committed 
- Type in informative commit message to avoid confusion 
- then commit the files, pull, push 



Git doesnt recognise folders unless it has content within it 

CAmelback is a method of naming files where there is no underscores e.g codeOfCodnuct (always start with lower case)(underscores is the other method)

DS store files are hidden files that os systems use to indicate what is in a folder (indexs files in a folder i.e. tracks whats in a folder) (need to put in gitignore)

Git has no way of tracking folders so when files are moved it sees it as a deletion in one area and addition in another area

In Rstudio Asterix means its a wildcard and no matter what file path there is if it ends in .example it will be ignored (gitignore)

Large files cannot be pushed i.e images, powerpoints etc 

best practice is to try and keep the git window in Rstudio as clear as possible to ensure the workspace can easily be navigated

if files are commited to github online that are not wanted they can be deleted online 

if Rproj files is deleted connected bwteen github and rstudio will be lost very important not too deleted 

if you go to file, recent projects it will give you a list of all the recent projects you have been working on 


All coding club tutorials should be uploaded to tutorial folder in personal github repository 

Highlighting all the code then cmd + enter runs all the code whereas having your cursor anywhere on that line of code will just run that line of code 

workspace is cleared in rstutio with broom icon

to make section headings in rstudio place 4 dashes or hastages after the comment written in the code, this allows you go between specific points in the code 

good practice to have a license in a file to allow access to anyone and allow them to know to use your repository and if you want credited etc. basically tells people what they can and cannot do with your repository 

creative commons license (images and more creative content) vs MIT (general coding, scripts and generations) 

if a license is not put in you retain copyright rights and nobody can access your work/repository 

keep issues on that one issue, then it will be closed if there is another unrelated question you can start your own new issue 


object orienatated programmming 

Object orientated programming languages 

objects have names and attritubytes (description of what type of object)

functions are actions (doing things) 

differences are when langausges are more focused on doing things (functionsal) or naming things (object)

names can be linked to the properties 


to improve readablility of script use spaces around symbols to make it clearer

double equals means equals as one equals sign can be used to assign objects 

Lots of different languagues each with their own benefits which need to be considered before use 

R is good for data analysis and visualisation 




TO DO 

- check out troubleshooting tutorial 
- Transfer across files to private reposiotry 
- transfer across coding club work into new repository
