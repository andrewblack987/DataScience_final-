# Glossary of Data Science terms 

## Component (R)
Like one data set stored in a zipped set of data sets. More formally, an item in a list. The length of a list is the number of components it has.

## Data science
is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, process, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from stuctured and unstructured data. 

## Data frame (R)
A data set. More formally, a set of vectors bound together in a list.
They can be different modes or classes (e.g., numeric and character), but they must have equal length.

## Database (R)
One data set or a set of them, or an add-on module. More formally, an item on the search list or something that might be. Can be an R data file or a package.

## Factor (R)
A categorical variable and its value labels. Value labels may be nothing more than “1,” “2,”. . . , if not assigned explicitly. More formally, the type of object that represents a categorical variable. It stores its labels
in its levels attribute.

## Function (R)
A command and/or a function. When you apply it down through cases, it is just like a Stata command. However, you can also apply it across rows like a Stata function. More formally, an R program that is stored as an object.

## Git
the programming language used by GitHub

## GitHub
a user interface that provides access control and collaborative work (a cloud through a website)

## Repository
a sort of 'master folder' that contains all of the files for a specific project or lab; a repository can be linked to R

## version control
a process that records every iteration of a document/script (used very effectively by GitHub!)

## Markdown
is a lightweigt markup language with plain formatting synthax. It creates documents that serve as a neat record of analysis.
(i.e: HTML, markdown is used in WordPress)

## Object (R)
A data set, a variable or even the equivalent of a Stata command). More formally, almost everything in R. If it has a mode, it is an object. Includes data frames, vectors, matrices, arrays, lists and functions.

## Object Oriented Programming (R)
A style of software in which the output of a procedure depends on the type of data you provide it. R has an object orientation, Stata added it in version 11.

## Vector (R)
A variable. It can exist on its own in memory or it can be part of a data set. More formally, a set of values that have the same mode, i.e. an atomic object.

## Workflow
COMMIT (the file is in the stagging area _ not yet accessible to all) - PULL (make sure you have the latest version of the file) - PUSH (add your changes and make it accessible to the cloud)  

## README.md file
A summary file containing information. Always used in repositories to explain their function and purpose. README.md files can also be used within folders to explain the folder content and function.
